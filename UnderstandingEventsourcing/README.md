# Understanding Eventsourcing
A C# implementation of the examples from the book: Understanding Eventsourcing - Planning and Implementing scalable Systems with Eventmodeling and Eventsourcing.
The book can be found here: https://leanpub.com/eventmodeling-and-eventsourcing. And the original examples can be found here: https://github.com/dilgerma/eventsourcing-book

My examples are implemented using my own event store implementation and compared to the original Kotlin/Axon examples I have tried to use as little magic as possible making it very clear what is going on.
